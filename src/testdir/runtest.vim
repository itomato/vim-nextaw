" This script is sourced while editing the .vim file with the tests.
" When the script is successful the .res file will be created.
" Errors are appended to the test.log file.

" The test script may contain anything, only functions that start with
" "Test_" are special.  These will be invoked and should contain assert
" functions.  See test_assert.vim for an example.
"
" It is possible to source other files that contain "Test_" functions.  This
" can speed up testing, since Vim does not need to restart.  But be careful
" that the tests do not interfere with each other.
"
" If an error cannot be detected properly with an assert function add the
" error to the v:errors list:
"   call add(v:errors, 'test foo failed: Cannot find xyz')
"
" If preparation for each Test_ function is needed, define a SetUp function.
" It will be called before each Test_ function.
"
" If cleanup after each Test_ function is needed, define a TearDown function.
" It will be called after each Test_ function.

" Without the +eval feature we can't run these tests, bail out.
